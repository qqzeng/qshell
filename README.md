# qshell

a tiny shell implementation

- simulate implementation on the system prompt
- implement some built-in commands, such as kill, jobs
- support pipe commands
- support input and ouput redirection
- support background jobs by designing bg process struct

anyway, it's a rough prototype just aimed at learning, and there are many features to be integrated and improved.
